This problem haunted me for several days! I really enjoyed playing around with it. I got stuck and eventually looked at some hints, and started looking at Chinese remainder theorem stuff, but eventually decided to keep at my original idea, and eventually got it working!

While playing around with small scale examples, I noticed that there was a regular distance between all valid answers. I used this idea to slowly check for distances between partial answers, and then start skipping how far you search.
